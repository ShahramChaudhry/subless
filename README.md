## 🚨 The Problem

Every month, thousands of people in the UAE lose money to **forgotten subscriptions** and **auto-renewals** they never meant to keep.  
Between Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Prime, and telecom bundles, these small charges quietly pile up.

💔 8 out of 10 users we spoke to had **no clear idea** how much they were paying every month.  
💸 The average user wastes **AED 800/month** on unused subscriptions.

It automatically detects recurring payments from emails and bank transactions, alerts you before renewals, and helps you cancel with one click.

No more surprises. No more “where did my money go?” moments.  
Just clarity, savings, and control — all in one place.
